# Boundaries

## Boundary Specificity

It can be difficult to determine how to split a string into words. That is why the [`convert`](../reference/convert.md/) uses a set of [default word boundaries](../reference/boundary.md/#textcase.boundary.DEFAULT_BOUNDARIES), but sometimes that isnâ€™t enough to meet a specific use case.

Say a string has the word `2D`, such as `scale2D`. No exclusive usage of [`convert`](../reference/converter.md/#textcase.converter.CaseConverter.convert) will be enough to solve the problem. In this case we can further specify which boundaries to split the string on. This library provides some [templates for achieving this specificity](../reference/boundary.md/#textcase.boundary). We can specify what boundaries we want to split on using instances of the [`Boundary`](../reference/boundary.md/#textcase.boundary.Boundary) class:

```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" tabs="specificity.py|output.txt" result="txt" hl_lines="7"
--8<-- "docs/.snippets/boundaries/specificity.py"
```

## Custom Boundaries

This library provides [a number of constants for boundaries associated with common cases](../reference/boundary.md/#textcase.boundary). But you can create your own boundary to split on other criteria:

```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" tabs="custom.py|output.txt" result="txt" hl_lines="8-11 16-20"
--8<-- "docs/.snippets/boundaries/custom.py"
```

To learn more about building a custom boundary from scratch, take a look at the [`textcase.boundary.Boundary`](../reference/boundary.md/#textcase.boundary.Boundary) class.
